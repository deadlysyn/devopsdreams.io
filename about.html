      <p class="about">
        I am a humble, collaborative, ambitious, and continuously improving
        DevOps engineer. I have been delivering large-scale distributed systems
        and mission critical infrastructure services for over two decades. In
        that time I have developed a wide range of experience which includes
        being an individual contributor, technical lead, architect and hands-on
        manager.
      </p>
      <p class="about">
        I am passionate about DevOps culture and SRE principles as ways to rally
        people with diverse backgrounds around shared outcomes; increasing
        productivity while simultaneously improving quality of life through
        tenancious pursuit of automation and elimination of toil.
      </p>
      <p class="about">
        I am familiar with multiple cloud infrastrcuture providers, including
        Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud, as well as multiple container
        orchestration frameworks including Kubernetes and Cloud Foundry. I am
        well versed in agile development practices, lean product thinking, and
        infrastructure as code.
      </p>
      <p class="about">
        I am pragmatic in both my work style and technology choices, seeing the
        world as a series of tradeoffs that must be carefully considered and
        occasionally reevaluted. I have worked fully remote for over a decade,
        am an excellent communicator, and highly effective at asynchronous
        collaboration. I value flexibility, autonomy and deep focus enabling a
        state of flow. I love Linux, Vim, Git and opportunities to solve new
        puzzles in a variety of languages.
