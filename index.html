            Mike's one of those people who can dive into a complex technology,
            spend a few weeks on it, and understand it in a way that makes it
            clear to others why the technology is worth adopting and overcomes
            the hurdles that it would take to do so.

            Mike is one of those rare people who can mold himself to whatever
            the team needs to best be successful. [He] has always been able to
            be a prime influencer and leader, despite being a remote worker. As
            someone who also had to be a leader working remotely, I can say this
            is no easy task - though Mike made it look that way.

            Mike is smart and hardworking. His willingness to help others,
            technical expertise, ability to get things done and be able to think
            through complex problems made him awesome to work with.

          <h4>Michael Mester, <em>Manager</em></h4>
          <p class="justified">
            Mike is a great leader, he thinks through complex problems and acts
            on them with precision. I have never known Mike to be short on
            technical expertise. From defining a product, building the
            architecture, and laying out the roadmap, Mike has demonstrated
            strong skills across the board.
